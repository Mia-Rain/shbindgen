## stand alone usage
# a script for compiling scripts into standalone tools
# is present in ./standalone.sh
# this simply calls ./bindgen.sh
# and then adds the data within $standalone
# at the end of the output
## compilation
# files in ./src or $src in .conf
# are compiled into functions based on their file names
# ie ./shcat -> shcat() { ...
##
## libraries
# files in ./lib or $lib in .conf
# are compiled first into functions as above
### shell doesn't require functions to be placed in a order
### but this is for future proofing mostly
##
## storage
# libraries should NEVER be pulled from a local source
# either being a form of git submod or unpacked release
# libraries should be well documented on where they originated from
# to prevent searching
### additionally functions are not pulled from the env
### at no time should a folder and file have the same name !!
##
## switches
# all functions can be disabled from compilation
# with a simple `disable="<filename>"` argument
# there is no recursion/delimiter handling so arguments should be given once per function
# folders of functions and/or libraries can also be disabled in this way
# ie disable="extended" disabled="additions"
##
## config
# ./.conf or conf="<filename>" can be used to provide configuration
# options include:
## $src for src folder
## $lib for lib folder
